## Weathering
- Breaking up of rocks
- 2 Types:
    * Physical/Mechanical weathering
    - Chemical weathering

### Physical Weathering
- Breaking up of rock due to temp.

### Chemical weathering
- Chemical change in rock structure
- Mor common in warm, moist
- Causes rock decay

## Erosion
- Process of carrying away of land surface.
- aka denudation
- 2 types:
    * Aggradation
    * Degradation

### Aggradation
- Landform is built by deposit. & acc. of material
- E.g.: Alluvial plain

### Degradation
- Lowering surface by erosion & removal of rock waste
- E.g.: Mushroom rock

### Erosional Agents
- 4 agents:
    * Running Water
    * Ice
    * Waves
    * Wind
