## Divisions

### Core
- Huge in size
- Radius of 3500 km
- Inner: solid
- Outer: liquid
- Very hot temp.:
    * Inner: 4700 -> 6700 C
    * Outer: 3700 -> 4700 C
- Consists of:
    * iron
    * nickel

### Mantle
- 2900 km thick
- Constant movement
- Upper aka Asthenosphere
- Temp.:
    *   Lower: 2800 C
    *   Upper: 1800 C
- Consists of:
    * iron
    * magnesium

### Crust

- Thinnest & Outermost
- 2 types:
    * Continental:
        + Below landforms
        + 40km -> 100km
        + 2 layers:
            + Lower: made of sima and basaltic rock
            + Upper: made of sial (Athenosphere)
    * Oceanic:
        + Below oceans
        + 6km thick
- 1% of Earth's mass

## Lava

![Lava](/Notes/assets/images/lava.png)

-   Lava: Molten rock that has reached the surface
-   Magma: Molten rock stored in the Earth\'s crust

## Rocks
- Parts of crust
- Formed by composition of solid aggregates of minerals in the solid state
- Minerals:
    * Silicon
    * Aluminium
    * Iron
    * Sodium
    * Calcium
    * Potassium
- Divided into three types:

### Igneous Rocks
- Ignis = 'fire' [latin]
- Cooling and hardening of magma/lava
- aka parent rocks
- Frquently have crystals making them look glassy
- Metals obtained from them: copper, tin
- Also contain: mica, basalt, granite, feldspar
- Devil's Tower [USA] formed by Igneous Intrusion
- 2 types:
    * Intrusive rocks:
        + Slow cooling under ground
        + Cools over 100/1000 yrs & develops large crystals
        + E.g.:
            + Granite
            + Gabbro: used in making tombstones
            + Diorite
            + Peridotite
    * Extrusive rocks:
        + Rapid cooling of magma on surface
        + E.g.:
            + Pumice
            + Basalt: dark grey, black
            + Trachyte
            + Andesite
            + Rhyolite

### Sedimentary Rocks
- Formed from weathering of pre-existing rocks
- Formed from tiny pieces of rocks, dead animals, plant & micro-orgs
- Takes 1000s of years to form
- Formation of sedimentary rocks:
1. Rivers carry stones, gravel, ...
2. Sediment settles at bootom of rivers & lakes: Sedimentation
3. Layers keep on depositing
4. Pressure falls on the lower layers: Compaction
5. Salt in layer causes cementing
- E.g.:
    * Sandstone (Red Fort)
    * Shale (Tiles)
    * Limestone
    * Conglomerate
    * Mudstone

### Metamorphic Rocks
