## Earth's Movements
- Earth moves around the sun
- Earth moves on its axis
- Constant movement everywhere inside the Earth
- 2 types of earth movements:
    * Endogenic Move.
    * Exogenic move.

### Endogenic Movements
- Acting inside the surface
- Moves. take place under/inside surface
- We cannot see but can feel
- 2 types:
    * Slow forces:
        + Tectonic plates move slowly
        + Cause formation of mountains
    * Sudden forces:
        + In a few hours
        + Volcanic eruption, earthquake
- E.g.: earthquakes, volcano

### Exogenic Movements
- Acting on the surface
- Moves. occur on surface
- Visible to us
- Occurs by:
    * Water
    * Wind
    * Ice
- E.g.:
    * Rivers erode mountains to form valleys, plains & plateaus

## Plate Tectonics
- Alfred Wegener proposed "Theory of Continental Drift" 1912
    * Believed that 225 mil yrs ago, 1 supercontinent - Pangea surround by single ocean called -----------
    * 150 mil yrs ago - Laurasia(North) & Gondwana(South)
    * 100 mil yrs ago - NA & SA & Africa & Europe & Asia & Australia & Antarctica & India
    * Plates move at 10cm/yr
- Plate tectonics
    * Between lithosphere and aesthenosphere
    * theory explains how continental plates move continuously - along, against, away
    * Continents sit on these plates
- Types of plate movements
    * Divergent: Moving away
    * Convergent: Moving close
    * Transform / Lateral Slipping

### Divergent movement
- 2 plates move away
- A gap opens up between the plates and magma from below seeps through to form new crust
- Forms rift valley

### Convergent movements
- 2 plates come close 2 each other
- Creates fold mountain
- Pushes up

### Lateral Slipping Plate Movement
- 2 plates move sideways against each other
- Tremendous amount of friction is generated
- The plates slip and stick as the friction and pressure build up
- When the pressure is release, the plates jerk apart
- Causes earthquake
