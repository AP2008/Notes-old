## Steps in nutrition
- Ingestion: Intake of food
- Digestion: Complex -> Simple
- Absorption: Absorb energy
- Assimilation: Simple -> Complex
- Egestion: Elimination of waste

## Digestion in humans
- Food passes through specific canal (elementary canal/ digestive tract)
- Digestive system = elementary canal + Digestive glands
- Parts of elementary canal (first 7) and digestive glands (last 3):

### Mouth & Buccal Cavity
- Process of taking food: ingestion
- Large pieces of food broken down
- Food mixes with saliva : secreted from salivary glands
- Tongue: taste of food by taste buds

### Esophagus
- Epigloatus directs the food into esophagus

### Stomach
- Widest part
- Churned and mixed with mucus (HCL acid & digestive juices)
- Acid kills bacteria
- Juices break down proteins
- Emptied into small intestine

### Small intestine
- 7.5m long
- Digestive juices mixed
- Inner wall has finger-like projections:
    * Increase surface area of food

### Large intestine


### Rectum


### Anus


### Salivary glands
- Secretes saliva

### Liver
- Largest gland
- Secretes bile 

### Pancreas
- Secretes pancreatic juice
- Breaks down carbs, prots., fats

## Digestion in Cow
- Special stomach with 4 chambers:
    * Rumen (largest part)
    * Reticulum
    * Omasum (smallest part)
    * Abomasum
- Ruminent: Animal that can bring back food from stomach
- Rumination: Process of bringing back food from stomach
- Process of digestion of food:
1. Quickly swallow grass and store in rumen
2. Food partially digested in rumen: cud
3. Cud is pushed into reticulum
4. Reticulum sends back cud back to mouth
5. Re-chewed food sent to Omasum
6. Excess water removed, broken down
7. Goes to Abomsum (True stomach)
8. Goes into small intestine
9. Absorption of nutrients
10. Caecum (sac-like) contains bacteria, breaks down cellulose
11. Goes into large intestine
